Dissertation Title:
Enhancing Deep Space Optical Navigation: Deep Learning Models for Mars and Asteroids Flyby Image Processing.

\section{Contributions}
The work presented in this study aims to provide a novel contribution to the fields of machine learning and autonomous optical navigation. The novel contributions of this study are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generation of Mars and Itokawa Datasets:} This study has successfully generated comprehensive and robust datasets for Mars and the asteroid Itokawa. The datasets include images and corresponding ground truth data, which are essential for training supervised models to accurately locate the center of brightness (CoB) and center of mass (CoM).
    \item \textbf{Development of the AstroNet Architecture:} A novel neural network architecture named AstroNet was developed in this study. AstroNet is a hybrid architecture that combines CNN and LSTM networks. AstroNet's architecture addresses the unique issues presented by deep space images, where traditional methods tend to fall short.
    \item \textbf{Development of Models for Tracking CoB and CoM of Mars and Itokawa:} The study resulted in the development of deep learning models capable of accurately tracking both the center of brightness (CoB) and center of mass (CoM) for Mars and the asteroid Itokawa. The models developed in this research represent a significant improvement over existing optical navigation methods, particularly in their ability to handle irregular shapes. They enhance spacecraft navigation autonomy and precision, enabling more reliable mission operations in deep space.
